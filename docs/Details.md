## Description

### :pencil: Summary (10-200 characters)

**sHierarchy** aims to be robust but keep both stability and compatiblity
high to developers.

### :pencil: Description

**sHierarchy** is meant to design that matches the Unity default settings.
With that being said, user should find familiars without forcing themselves
learning a new tool.

We choose to design a minimalistic hierarchy without over exaggerate the tool
itself. Yet the tool should be powerful enough for developers to use for their
daily tasks. 

#### Principles

* **Plug 'n' play**, it works out of the box
* **Lightweight**, no other dependencies
* **Does not pollute (project)**, no files are generated
* **Clean**, no other resource files
* **Stable and compatible**, no hacky code
* **Open Source**, anyone can help us improve!

#### Features

* Control all over **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **sHierarchy** panel
* Display icon for each GameObject and Components
* Display enable/disable state of each GameObject/Components
* Display log/warning/error icon (behind the name of GameObject)
* Displaying tag and layer of a GameObject
* Displaying instance ID of a GameObject
* Any feature can be disabled
* Work in play mode
* Work in prefab isolation mode

*P.S. Notice this package will only work in Editor, and does not expect user
to use it in production builds.*

### :pencil: Technical details

This plugin is base on top of [Custom Hierarchy for Unity](https://github.com/febucci/unitypackage-custom-hierarchy)
made by author [Federico](https://github.com/febucci). Thankfully, Federico
has granted us the permission to sell on to market, due to the changes we
have changed!

The source can be compiled in .NET 2.0 or above, hence all .NET version should
work well with this plugin.

This tool has been tested on Unity version 2019, but we would recommended you
use this package in Unity version 2021. We would continue support the latest
version of Unity Engine.

Notice the tool is open source; so you can find the full source code on GitHub,
the link https://github.com/Pixisoft/sHierarchy. Feel free to open issues if
you have question about the tool, or even better if you like to contribute
to the package by opening pull requests!
